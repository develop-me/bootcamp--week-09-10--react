You can deploy you React site to GitHub pages easily.
\\

We'll use an NPM package called \texttt{gh-pages} to make our lives easier.

\section{Setup}

First, install the \texttt{gh-pages} package

\begin{minted}{bash}
    npm install gh-pages
\end{minted}

Next, update the \texttt{homepage} property in your \texttt{package.json}:

\begin{minted}{json}
    "homepage": "https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/",
\end{minted}

Then add the following two lines to the \texttt{scripts} object in your \texttt{package.json}:

\begin{minted}{json}
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
\end{minted}


\pagebreak


\section{Deploying}

Whenever you want to update your site run:

\begin{minted}{bash}
    npm run deploy
\end{minted}

If your forget to do this, it won't update!
\\

Deployment can take a minute or two sometimes. You can go to \\ \texttt{https://github.com/<github-username>/<repo>/deployments} to see if a deployment is in progress.
\\

Once deployment is done, you can visit:\\ \texttt{https://<github-username>.github.io/<repo>/}
