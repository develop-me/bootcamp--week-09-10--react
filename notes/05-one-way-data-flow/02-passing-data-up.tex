\section{Passing Data Up}

We can use the same process to get data out of a component without needing to break one-way data flow.
\\

Say that you have a \texttt{<Counter>} component:

\inputminted{js}{05-one-way-data-flow/figures/07-Counter.jsx}

How could we add a button which, when clicked, passes the current value of the counter up to the parent component?

We can't pass data up with props, but we can pass arguments to functions:

\inputminted{js}{05-one-way-data-flow/figures/08-Counter-with-parent.jsx}

In the parent component we can accept this argument as a parameter to the function we pass in:

\inputminted{js}{05-one-way-data-flow/figures/09-Parent.jsx}

Again, we've still got one-way data flow: the \texttt{<Counter>} component doesn't need to know \textit{anything} about the \texttt{<Parent>} component. As long as the parent component passes in a \texttt{handleSubmit} prop, which is a function that accepts a single argument, everything will work.
\\

Also note that the parent component can't \textit{ask} for the data from \texttt{<Counter>}, it can only get it when some event happens inside \texttt{<Counter>}. Really we're not getting data \textit{out} of the sub-component, we're passing \textit{in} a function from \texttt{<Parent>}.
