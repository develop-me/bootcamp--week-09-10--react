\section{Passing Data Up}

We can use a similar process to get data out of a component without needing to break one-way data flow.
\\

Say that you have a \texttt{<Counter>} component:

\js{}{01-one-way-data-flow/figures/07-Counter}

How could we add a button which, when clicked, passes the current value of the counter up to the parent component?
\\

We can't pass data up with props, but we can pass arguments to functions:

\js{}{01-one-way-data-flow/figures/08-Counter-with-parent}

In the parent component we can accept this argument as a parameter to the function we pass in:

\js{}{01-one-way-data-flow/figures/09-Parent}

Again, we've still got one-way data flow: the \texttt{<Counter>} component doesn't need to know \textit{anything} about the \texttt{<Parent>} component. As long as the parent component passes in a \texttt{handleSubmit} prop, which is a function that accepts a single argument, everything will work.
\\

Also note that the parent component can't \textit{ask} for the data from \texttt{<Counter>}, it can only get it when some event happens inside \texttt{<Counter>}. Really we're not getting data \textit{out} of the sub-component, we're passing \textit{in} a function from \texttt{<Parent>}.
