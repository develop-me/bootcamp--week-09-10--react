# Day 6

## Pre-Built Components

- one way data flow means can use component anywhere in app
- can use in *any* React app
- large ecosystem of components
- rely on documentation

### React Bootstrap

- include Bootstrap CSS file
- `npm install react-bootstrap`
- `<Button variant="primary">Button</Button>`
- Documentation is key
- DOM props get passed through
- redo `<Buttons>` with BS
- Mention React Native


### React Datepicker

- writing date picker is hard
- `npm install react-datepicker`
- `import "react-datepicker/dist/react-datepicker.css";`
- uses `Date` objects
- `<DatePicker selected={ date } onChange={ this.handleDate } />`
