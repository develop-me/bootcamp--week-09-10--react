# Challenges

- **Use Git to make a commit every time you get an answer working. Use sensible commit messages.**

- For some of these challenges you may want to create more than one component type. Try not to let your JSX get too unwieldy. Create new directories if you're using multiple component types.

- Make sure you keep React DevTools ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)/[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)) + JS console open at all times and correct anything that it flags up.

## `useReducer`

Use Hooks for all of the challenges below.


## Tricksy Challenges

1) Create a `<LameGame aim={ x }>` component. When a "Start" button is pressed it displays "{ aim } seconds" and shows a "Now" button. The idea is to click the "Now" button as close to `aim` seconds after you pressed "Start". Once you click on "Now" it should tell you how close you were in 1/10ths of a second. The "Start" and "Now" buttons should only show when relevant.
