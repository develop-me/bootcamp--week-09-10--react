## To Do

- More React Router information
    * [ ] Hash router for deployment
    * [ ] Routes inside non-App components
- Switch to `.js` instead of `.jsx`
    * [ ] Add a note about Sublime Text support
    * [ ] Challanges
    * [ ] Notes

    * [ ] this.state available everywhere
- Diagram explaining classes
    * [ ] Show methods being inside class but not each other
    * [ ] Show scope of `this`
    * [ ] Show that `this.props` and `this.state` are available anywhere in the class
- Add more info about `exact` path in ReactRouter
- Add more info about setState() ordering
- A bit more about what a Component actually is - creates a class, when used creates an instance
- Rewrite Lifting State notes - folks still a bit confused by it all
    > Just have the buttons material - get rid of the Form stuff
    * [ ] Diagram
    * [x] Notes on how we get what looks like two way flow
    * [x] Rename props to `handleClick` instead of `onClick`
    * [ ] List of steps for lifting state
- Use function version of `setState` in notes/examples
    > Should use `setState` as a function to avoid any asynchronous rendering issues
    * [ ] Notes
    * [ ] Challenge Answers
    * [ ] Blog Form code?
- Class properties
- Static keyword
    * [ ] Methods
    * [ ] Properties?
- Update to use Bootstrap 4

## Doing


## Done

- Update to using `<>` instead of `React.Fragment`
- Update answers/example to use handleX instead of onX when passing around functions
- For state have some challenges that just turn stateless into stateful components - maybe some more simple challenges
